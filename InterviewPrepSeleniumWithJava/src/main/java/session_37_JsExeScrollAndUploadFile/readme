JavaScriptExecutor is an interface implemented by "remoteWebDriver" along with WebDriver and TakeScreenshot
interface.
JavaScriptExecutor >> is having executeScript() method >> with which we can execute javaScript

NOTE: - elementIntercepted exception >> calling click method and click method is not able to execute JS
 internally >>
 so instead of click we will use executeScript()

 >> Using JSExecutor instead of .click() & .sendKeys()

 >> Interesting part
 if WebDriver driver= new ChromeDriver();
 Then you need to cast the the >>Upcasting
    JavascriptExecutor js= (JavascriptExecutor) driver;

 else if
 ChromeDriver driver= new ChromeDriver();
 Then
JavascriptExecutor js= driver; >> this will do without casting
